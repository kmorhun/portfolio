    <h2>Proposition: Under Mayor Bill de Blasio, the police became less abusive of their power</h2>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Filtering out Unsubstantiated Reports</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Rating: -1.5</li>
						<li>The Unsubstantiated reports, when added to the visualization, do not support
							the story that I'm trying to tell, which is critical of deBlasio. While it is not 
							<em>untrue</em> that the number of exonerated and substantiated reports has increased
							under deBlasio, this hides the fact that total number of complaints has actually decreased under
							deBlasio.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Filtering out 2019 Data</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Rating: -2</li>
						<li>The 2019 data shows the total number of complaints decreasing,
							which is not consistent with the story that I'm trying to show. 
							By filtering out the 2019 data, it makes the increase in complaints more 
							salient, which is emphasized by the arrow. There is no reason not to include
							this data besides wanting to make the chosen story more persuasive.  
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Make the total reports arrow grow thicker over time</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rating: 1</li>
					<li>This is an earnest and subtle way to emphasize the change in number of reports over time. It draws
						the reader's attention to the totel number of reports increasing and the arrow suggests that a future
						increase is imminent. Because the rest of the data filtering is so deceptive, this 
						design decision serves to support it, but on its own it's a nice touch.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Annotate 2014 and color-code republican and democratic mayoral times</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rating: 2</li>
					<li>The point of the visualization is to show the effect of deBlasio's tenure on police complaint reports.
						Bloomberg, a Republican, was mayor from 2002-2013, and deBlasio, a Democrat, was mayor from 2014-2019, so 
						annotating 2014 and color-coding the mayoral times is a good way to emphasize the change in leadership. The blue and red 
						colors are classes democrat/republican colors, and I hand drew an annotation to make the year that
						deBlasio took office more perceptually obvious.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Many tick marks and grid lines</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rating: 1</li>
					<li>This design choice is subtle, but it's always useful to have gridlines to 
						more easily compare values. The deception comes in when you take into consideration the other deceptive 
						factors in the chart, which this feature continues to support. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

		<p>
			Design Decisions and Rationale:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Including all years and all types of reports</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rating: 2</li>
					<li>Luckily, including all of the data supports the conclusion that
						under deBlasio, complaints against police officers have decreased. 
						Especially compared against the prior visualization, this is a very honest way to present the data.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Order of vertical bar stacks</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rating: -1</li>
					<li>Although all of the data is there, the order of the vertical bar graphs is intentional, 
						and it emphasizes the decrease in unsubstantiated complaints while masking the increase in 
						exonerated complaints by placing each bar on an unaligned axis. Any other order would make this increase
						more obvious, so I didn't want to highlight this. It doesn't show the whole story.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<li>No tick marks or grid lines</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rating: -0.5</li>
					<li>In contrast to the visualization above, I did not include grid lines in the graph
						because the first few bars after deBlasio took office don't actually easily support the story
						that the graph is trying to tell, and I wanted to dissuade the reader form looking too hard at those
						initial years and comparing values to each other. Instead, I wanted them to focus on the more abvious decrease right at the end.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Annotate 2014 and color-code republican and democratic mayoral times</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Rating: 1.5</li>
					<li>With similar reasoning as in the first visualization, I annotated the background with blue and red 
						to emphasize republican and deBlasio's tenure, and I still think this is earnest. The bar colors of the 
						earlier years blend into the backgroung slightly, which is intentional, as it serves as a good contrast for the 
						"clarity" that deBlasio's democratic tenure brings (which is why this rating isn't a full 2).
					</li>
