			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Owners and Evictions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Do minority (non-white) demographic groups tend to live in low-owner occupancy regions?</li>
					<ul><li>Motivation: Similarly to my motivation from the first question, assuming that corporate and absentee
						ownership leads to a greater number of eviction filings as 
						<em>Housing Justice Beyond the Emergency</em> suggests,
						I wanted to confirm that Boston's distribution of corporate and absentee ownership
						is correlated with its minority population distribution, and gain some insights
						into how much more vulnerable Boston's non-white population is to getting evicted.
					</li></ul>
				<li>How has COVID-19 and the moratorium on evictions affected corporate/absentee ownership in the Greater Boston Area?</li>
					<ul><li>Motivation: According to <em>Housing Justice Beyond the Emergency</em>,
						the Massachusetts moratorium on evictions and foreclosures was lifted
						in October 2020, and that neighborhoods with more 
						absentee and corporate landlords saw more eviction filings. 
						The dataset does not include eviction data, but it does include corporate and absentee ownership data,
						so I wanted to confirm that the data supports this earlier research.</li></ul>
				<li>What relationship does corporate ownership have with domestic unit vacancy?</li>
					<ul><li>Motivation: I presume that landlords are more likely to evict their 
						tenants if they believe they can easily find new ones. I also presume that
						corporate landlords are more likely to evict their tenants than individual landlords, 
						because they are less likely to have personal relationships with their tenants.
						In the article <em>In 83 Million Eviction Records, a Sweeping and Intimate New Look at Housing in America</em>,
						the authors emphasize the opaqueness of the eviction appeal process, and I would assume that 
						corporate landlords are more likely to take advantage of this opaqueness to more easily evict their tenants.
						To this end, I wanted to see if corporate ownership is correlated with domestic unit vacancy.
					</li></ul>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<p>I've already made several assumptions of the data, the most prominent of which is 
				the assumption that all corporate ownership is the same. In reality, both university-owned apartments
				and large corporate-owned apartments buildings are included, and I presume the former is less likely to evict
				its tenants than the latter, and that removing college students from housing does not count as an eviction in 
				the same way that removing a family from housing does. I do not filter out regions with a high percentage
				of college students, but I took note of them and factored them into my analysis of the data.
			</p>

			<p>Let's begin with some univariate summaries and data quality issues.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="rates_hist.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				First, a few histograms of the variables we are most interested in. 
				So far so good. Both rates have values between 0 and 1, and 
				there are no glaring outliers in the distribution. The overall 
				corporate ownership rate is lower than I would have expected.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="pct_college.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Let's take a look as the distributions of some demographic groups around Boston.
				This graph takes the number of college students in a region and the total population
				of that region and generates a calculated field that is the percentage of college students in the region.
				Evidently, Longwood and Fenway are the regions with the highest percentage of college students,
				which is not surprising given the presence of BU and several other universities in the area.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="pctcorrectional.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This graph was generated in the same way as the previous one, but it calculates the percentage of 
				the population in correctional facilities. Notably, Roxbury is marked as having the greatest
				percentage of its population in correctional facilities. However, this may or may not be a data quality issue, 
				since I was not able to find a correctional facility located in Roxbury to explain this. The Suffolk County House of Correction
				is located in the region covered by South Boston, but South Boston is not included among the neighborhoods
				with a number of residents in correctional facilities. In any case, <strong>is worth paying close attention to Roxbury.</strong> 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="demographics_by_nhood.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The figure above depicts a subset of the racial distribution of Boston by neighborhood.
				Some notable trends to notice are that the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of black residents
				are Mattapan, Hyde Park, Roxbury, and Dorchester. East Boston has the highest percentage of Hispanic residents, 
				Chinatown has the highest percentage of Asian and Pacific Islander residents, and the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of white residents are 
				North End, Beacon Hill, South Boston, and the South Boston Waterfront.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="acor_aoor_by_year.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The figure above depicts how the corporate ownership rate and the owner occupancy rate have changed over time. 
				The most notable trends are that <strong>the corporate ownership rate has increased over time, while the owner occupancy rate has decreased.</strong>
				Just around 2020, the corporate ownership rate seems to start rising at a faster rate, but the owner occupancy rate seems
				unaffected. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="aoor_vs_acor_by_nhood.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Let's explore the relationship between corporate ownership and owner occupancy. 
				The graph above compares the two rates, averaged over all years (from 2004 to 2024), for each neighborhood.
				Each mark is also colored and sized by the percentage of black residents in the neighborhood. Curiously,
				<strong>the neighborhoods with the highest proportion of black residents tended to have
				lower corporate ownership rates and higher owner occupancy rates</strong>, which runs contrary to my initial hypothesis.
				Roxbury shows itself to be an outlier for this pattern, which <strong>may suggest that the nature of 
				corporate ownership in Roxbury is different</strong> from the nature of corporate ownership in other neighborhoods.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Wishing to address the question of corporate and absentee ownership over time, 
				I experimented with several ways of encoding time in the following visualizations. 
				Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and emphasizes different aspects of the data.</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="moor_vs_cor_by_nhood.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The above graph is admittedly busy and not the most intuitive to parse, but it offers 
					some useful insights that may be visualized in an alternate way. Each line represents a neighborhood's 
					corporate ownership and owner occupancy rate over time, with the top of the line representing 2004,
					and the bottom representing 2024. The lines are colored by the percent of non-white residents in the neighborhood.
					Second, the axes for both corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates are reversed to emphasize that the parametric direction of 
					the two rates over time travels from the top to the bottom and from left to right, and to emphasize the negative
					consequence of the changes in the rates. From this visualization, the most notable feature is the highlighted
					<strong>South Boston Waterfront neighborhood, which seems to experience the most volatility in both rates over time,
					especially starting in 2008.</strong> 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/GBpA8LsFCsg">See the animation here</a> 				
				<figcaption>
					This perspective on the rates over time more explicitly shows the passage of time within
					each neighborhood, but each neighborbood must be viewed independently, so it may be difficult to 
					make comparisons between neighborhoods with this visualization. The same insights from the first visualization
					apply. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/xwgbCLg30A8">See the animation here</a>
				<figcaption>
					This final visualization of the raw rates over time was created by 
					joining the existing data with a geospatial dataset of the relevant Boston neighborhoods,
					which was linked in the metadata of the original dataset. The result is a side-by-side comparison
					of corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates over time. This visualization places
					the most emphasis on the geographic distribution of the rates over time, and the geographic 
					inequities in their distribution. It also visually emphasizes the <strong>increase in corporate ownership growth and 
					decrease in owner occupancy rate starting around 2020, or the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong> 
					A weakness of this visualization is its lack of quantitative information, so I used this insight to 
					inspire the next visualization.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="null_nhood_map.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					But first, a <strong>data quality issue</strong>! The map above shows an unnamed geographic neighborhood
					which does not correspond to any of the neighborhoods in the original dataset, and which does not have quantitative
					data associated with it. I suspect that it is an artifact of a data join where not every geographic
					neighborhood has an equivalent in the original dataset. For this reason, I have removed it from all geographic visualizations of the data. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="demo_maps.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					As a sanity check before moving on to a more detailed analysis of corporate and absentee ownership,
					over time, I also mapped several subsets of the demographic data to compare to the geographic distribution of the rates.
					This visualization emphasizes that <strong>the regions with the highest rates of corporate ownership are actually the regions with the highest
					percentage of white residents, and that the regions with the highest rates of owner occupancy are the regions with the highest percentage of black residents.</strong>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>In order to get a quantifiable measure of the change in corporate and absentee ownership over time, I calculated the year-over-year percentage difference
				The next 6 visualizations are the results of these calculations. The data broken down by demographics are filtered 
				to only include the years between 2018 and 2024, for ease of visual comprehension.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="pctdif_cor_vs_year.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure depicts the change in corporate ownership rate in Boston over time. 
				The key insight to strengthen here is that, <strong>in 2020, the corporate ownership rate increases
				by over 25%, an all-time high since 2004.</strong> The change in rate appears to have returned to its normal levels
				in recent years, but there is not enough data to confirm this. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="pctdiff_oor_vs_year.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure depicts the change in ownership occupancy rate in Boston over time.
				There appears to be a slight inclination towards a decrease in owner occupancy over time,
				but the change is not as drastic as the change in corporate ownership rate. 
				<strong>The COVID-19 pandemic does not appear to have had a significant effect on the owner occupancy rate overall.</strong>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>


			<figure>
				<img src="pctdiff_cor_black.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure depicts the change in corporate ownership rate in Boston around the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing
				on the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of black residents. 
				The largest change in corporate ownership rate (+120%) did indeed occur in 2020.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="pctdiff_cor_white.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure depicts the change in corporate ownership rate in Boston around the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing
				on the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of white residents. 
				The largest change in corporate ownership rate (+140%) did indeed occur in 2020. This is 
				a more drastic change than in the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of black residents.
				Additionally, the <strong>South Boston Waterfront neighborhood, which was the most volatile in the previous visualizations, continues
				to show itself to be an outlier</strong> in this visualization, occasionally changing rates in the opposite direction of the rest of the neighborhoods.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="pctdiff_oor_black.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure depicts the change in ownership occupancy rates in Boston around the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing
				on the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of black residents. 
				2020 did indeed bring a significant change in the owner occupancy rate, but <strong>for 
				these neighborhoods, owner occupancy rates increased during the pandemic.</strong>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="pctdiff_oor_white.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure depicts the change in ownership occupancy rates in Boston around the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing
				on the neighborhoods with the highest percentage of white residents. 
				2020 did indeed bring a significant change in the owner occupancy rate. For 
				these mostly white neighborhoods, owner occupancy rates decreased during the pandemic. <strong>
				This runs contrary to the pattern experienced by the mostly black neighborhoods.</strong>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="pctnonwhite_pctvacant.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Finally, to address my final question, investigating the relationship between corporate ownership and domestic unit vacancy,
					I created a scatterplot of the percentage of non-white residents in a neighborhood and the percentage of vacant domestic units in that neighborhood.
					Each neighborhood is represented by a point, and colored and sized by the average corporate ownership rate between 2004 and 2024.
					While <strong>there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between the percent of nonwhite residents and the percent of vacant domestic units</strong> (although, if you remove Roxbury,
					which was previously suspected to be an outlier, the correlation becomes stronger), there appears to be a trend of <strong>higher corporate ownership rates being associated with higher percentages of vacant domestic units.</strong>
					Fenway and Longwood have more college students than any other neighborhood, so without a more detailed
					breakdown of types of corporate owners, it is difficult to decide whether these two neighborhoods
					weaken the correlation, or whether they are outliers and should be removed from this analysis. In either case,
					<strong>South Boston Waterfront is once again a notable point to pay attention to, as it has one of the highest average corporate ownership rates, and has the highest percentage of vacant domestic units.</strong>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>There are several key insights to take away from this exploratory data analysis, 
				several questions to follow up on, and several additional sources of data to find to address these questions.</p>

			<h3>Key Insights</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Be careful when joining datasets, as you may end up with null entries</li>
				<li>Corporate ownership rates have been increasing over time, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this increase.</li>
				<li>Owner occupancy rates have been decreasing over time, but the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant effect on this rate.</li>
				<li>Neighborhoods with the highest percentage of black residents tend to have lower corporate ownership rates and higher owner occupancy rates</li>
				<li>Neighborhoods with the highest percentage of white residents tend to have higher corporate ownership rates and lower owner occupancy rates</li>
				<li>In 2020, white neighborhoods experienced a greater uptick in corporate ownership rates than black neighborhoods</li>
				<li>In 2020, white neighborhoods experienced a decrease in ownership occupancy rates, whereas black neighborhoods experienced an increase</li>
				<li>Neighborhoods with higher corporate ownership rates tend to have higher percentages of vacant domestic units, but there is not a strong correlation between the percentage of non-white residents and the percentage of vacant domestic units.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Follow-Up Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the nature of corporate ownership in Roxbury, and is it different from the nature of corporate ownership in other neighborhoods?</li>
				<ul><li>Roxbury seems to have a large population of adults in corrections facilities, but I am not sure where exactly these residents are living.
					Is there a correctional facility in Roxbury that I am not aware of? If not, what is the explanation for this data strangeness?
				</li></ul>
				<li>What makes South Boston Waterfront's corporate and absentee ownership rates so volatile?</li>
				<ul><li>The Waterfront neighborhood is generally an expensive place to live, so it is possible that the volatility in rates is 
					due to the the speculative nature of the real estate market in the area. However, I would need more data to confirm this.
				</li></ul>
				<li>What is the nature of corporate ownership in Fenway and Longwood? Is it mostly university ownership, as I suspect?</li>
				<ul><li>These neighborhoods have the highest percentage of college students, and I suspect that the corporate ownership in these neighborhoods
					is mostly university-owned housing. If this is the case, then the corporate ownership rate in these neighborhoods is not as concerning as it would be if it were mostly large corporate-owned apartment buildings,
					and should be treated differently in any analysis of eviction rates.
				</li></ul>
				<li>Are all corporate owners the same? Do they tend to own residential homes in certain regions over others?</li>
				<ul><li>It is possible that the corporate owners in the dataset are mostly large corporate-owned apartment buildings, but it is also possible that they are mostly university-owned housing, or some other type of corporate owner.
					A more detailed breakdown of the types of corporate owners and their distributions could clarify this.
				</li></ul>
				<li>How does all of this information connect to actual eviction filing data? Which regions have higher eviction rates, and 
					do they correlate with any of the trends I've found in this dataset?</li>
				<ul><li>It is possible that the trends I've found in this dataset do not correlate with eviction rates at all, and that the eviction rates are driven by other factors. 
					However, if the trends I've found do correlate with eviction rates, then this dataset could be used to predict which regions are most vulnerable to eviction.
				</li></ul>
				<li><em>Why</em> do black neighborhoods have a lower corporate ownership rate and higher owner occupancy rate?</li>
				<ul><li>It is possible that corporate owners actually actively avoid black neighborhoods due to "desirability" or other factors, and that this is the reason for the lower corporate ownership rate.
					However, this would imply that there are other factors driving high eviction rates in black neighborhoods, and I would need more data to confirm this.
				</li></ul>
				<li><em>Why</em> does the owner occupancy rate of black neighborhoods increase in 2020?</li>
				<ul><li>It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a decrease in the number of people moving in and out of these neighborhoods, and that this is the reason for the increase in owner occupancy rates.
					However, this effect is not seen in white neighborhoods, so some other factors must be at play here. 
				</li></ul>
			</ol>

			<h3>Additional Data needed</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Eviction filing data</li>
				<li>More detailed breakdown of types of corporate owners and their distributions</li>
				<li>More detailed breakdown of types of domestic units and their distributions</li>
			</ol>
