			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Population Pyramid: Familiar chart when working with age and sex data</li>
				<li>Pink and blue color scheme: chosen because pink and blue have historically been easily recognizable cultural markers for male and female sex categories in the US Census</li>
				<li>Double axes: chosen to make it easier to read  data values near the top and the bottom of the chart</li>
				<li>I was planning to label the vertical axis with age but didn't plan for enough space when drawing, so I ended up writing the ages in the clear portions of each bar. I don't hate it, but it can be easily confused with the concept that you write values of the bars at the end of the bars.</li>
				<li>Big tick marks at 3000 marks, and smaller tick marks at 1000: chosen to make it as easy as possible to determine absolute values</li>
				<li>Solid bars and Clear bars: chosen to fit more data into the same space and allow easy comparison between years.</li>
				<li><strong>Communicated well:</strong> Absolute population values, variations within a sex category</li>
				<li><strong>Not communicated well:</strong> Actually answering the posed question, relative difference in changes between make and female populations</li>
				<li><strong>Goals for next visualization: </strong> Put a more direct focus on change and the differences between sex, rather than on absolute values.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Less Detailed Axis: Absolute change in value less important than relative changes between ages and sex</li>
				<li>Arrows instead of Bars: Implicitly emphasizes population growth rather than a static value</li>
				<li>Arrow with less change placed in front: make it easily discernable to the reader which sex had less change</li>
				<li>Dotted line at age bin 25: Draw some attention to the unique quality of this bin, without taking away from other parts of the graph</li>
				<li><strong>Communicated well:</strong> Excellent at relative differences, shows regions of interest at ages 0-25, 30-65, and 70-90</li>
				<li><strong>Not communicated well:</strong> Absolute population counts disappear, not much context about the total sizes of these populations</li>
				<li><strong>Goals for next visualization: </strong>Challenge myself not to use bars or bar-adjacent marks</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Small Multiples/Trellis display: emphasize change over time and bring total populations back into focus</li>
				<li>Shapes as point markers: Additional differentiation between male/female sex data</li>
				<li>Thicker outline around legend: make it obvious that the legend is not a part of the visualization</li>
				<li><strong>Communicated well: </strong>Relative start and end points of population counts</li>
				<li><strong>Not communicated well: </strong> The same trends from graph 2 are more hidden in this display</li>
				<li><strong>Goals for future visualizations: </strong>Pull away from the pink/blue color scheme, as it is arbitrarily chosen and comes with a lot of social baggage</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		Sketch 1 was great at depicting absolute population values - you can even point out the baby boomer generation, who 
		would have been between 35 and 50 in 2000. However, it struggled to answer my question about the differences
		in relative changes of population between males and females. Sketch 2 was great at showing relative changes in population,
		at the expence of absolute population values. You can point out the turning points in the population growth at age 25 and age 65, 
		ages that align with major life milestone (joining the workforce and retirement), suggesting a pattern or external factor to investigate.
		Sketch 3 tries to capture both absolute and relative change, and while it does show some interesting differences in 
		starting/ending points, the ratios of the graphs makes it difficult to find any obvious trends - perhaps changing 
		the aspect ratios of each mini-graph would help. I think design 2 is most effective at answering the question I set out to answer, 
		while also highlighting an interesting trend in age to follow up on. In my final visualization, I intend to
		take heavy inspiration from sketch 2, but play around with exactly which data is encoded in the heights of the arrows (maybe working 
		with percent difference as opposed to absolute values). I also intend to use a different color scheme than pink and blue, as there is 
		no reason to use these colors other than commercial and cultural tradition.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				For my final visualization, I took heavy inspiration from my second sketch, effectively recreating
				it digitally. I used a different color scheme - purple for female population changes and green for male population changes.
				I chose these colors because they provide a decent enough contrast without invoking the same cultural baggage as pink and blue.
				Many of my design choices are the same as in my sketch - I used arrows instead of bars to emphasize change,
				and I used a less detailed vertical axis to emphasize relative change over absolute change. I used a double vertical axis 
				to make it easier to read the data values near the center and right of the chart. 
			</p>

			<p>
				These design decisions were chosen to emphasize relative change between the male and female populations, 
				which was the main question I set out to answer. As with the sketch, this visualization downplays the absolute population counts. Regardless,
				I believe that the visualization does suggest a story, although more data would be needed to confirm it. Starting from the age that
				people are able to work, the female population grows more than the male population over the 100 years.
				It's possible this could be due to males generally being tasked with more dangerous jobs throughout the 20th century, from mining to construction, among others. 
				It would be interesting to see this data cross-referenced with workplace injury and death data during the same time period. 
				Additionally, there are many more female septegenarians and octogenarians in the 2000 population compared to males than in the 1900 population, which could be 
				due to a variaty of factors, including long-term health effects of those dangerous jobs from earlier in their lives, or it could be otherwise
				correlated with the fact that women generally have longer life expectency. In any case, this graph brings up more questions to pursue in future research while 
				encouraging the reader to ponder, which I think is an excellent effect for a visualization to have. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As for my design process, I began by modifying the original csv to reformat the data into a form I can more easily work with. Then,
				I opened Tableau and fiddled with the bar graph settings until I got something that looked like my sketch. 
				dual axes and a shape mark for the arrows. However, since both the female and the male population changes used dual axes, Tableau was unwilling
				to combine the axes further to overlay the two charts on top of each other. Therefore, I pivoted to an online 
				image editor called Pixlr, where I was able to overlay the two charts on top of each other. Finally, to create the legend, I 
				used a different editing software that was more aligned with my technical capabilities, finalizing my design. 
      		</p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		I greatly appreciated the opportunity to design visualizations on paper, first. It allowed me to think more creatively about how I could
		represent the data and what I wanted to emphasize, without getting caught up in the exact technical difficulties that I ended up running into 
		when I tried to recreate my sketch digitally. If I had not had in mind the sketch I was trying to recreate, I never would have thought to try
		creating that visualization in Tableau, because there were a lot of technical barriers involved in its creation. If anything, I like the final design of my sketch
		better than the final design of my digital visualization, minus the color scheme. In the future, I intend to sketch out some example visualizations before I 
		try anything ditigally, because pencil and paper are much more forgiving than a digital tool, especially when you are still learning how to use the tool.
