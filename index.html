        <div id="intro">
            <p>My name is Kateryna, a Ukrainian-American MIT student 
            pursuing public interest technology.</p>
            <p>I am committed to using my technological and 
            interpersonal skills for social good, and help 
            others do the same. In particular, I am passionate 
            about involving ethics into every step of the 
            development process, from ideation to data collection, 
            development, and deployment. I believe that the only 
            way to build a more equitable world is to do it 
            relentlessly and holistically.</p>
            <p> The fields I follow and am interested in pursuing 
            internships in include machine learning engineering,
            AI regulation and technology policy, education 
            technology, and urban/transportation planning. I 
            believe it is crucial for us to interrogate the 
            status quo we find ourselves in and ask how we 
            can change our systems to be more equitable, 
            sustainable, and maintainable.</p>   
            <p>My personal philosophy doesn't end with my 
            professional interests - I have been ballroom dancing 
            competitively for over 15 years, and have experienced
            first-hand the effects of applying this philosophy 
            to my own physical body. I am convinced that this 
            can and must be applied to the larger societal 
            systems we find ourselves in.</p>
